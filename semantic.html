                        difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future

                    <p>Dogs are incredibly loyal, intelligent, and versatile animals, often called "Man's best friend" for their deep bond with
                    humans, serving as companions, protectors, and helpers in roles from therapy to police work; they provide unconditional
                    love, reduce stress, and encourage activity, making them beloved family members, despite requiring care like walks,
                    proper food, and vet visits.</p>
