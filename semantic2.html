                <h2>Facts About mammals</h2>
                <p>
                Mammals are defined by having hair/fur, being warm-blooded, breathing air with lungs, and, uniquely, feeding their young
                milk from mammary glands, with humans, whales, and bats all falling into this diverse group.

                <p>Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates defined by having hair/fur, mammary glands (producing milk for young), a backbone,
                and typically giving live birth (except monotremes like platypuses). They are incredibly diverse, living in nearly every
                habitat, and possess complex brains, allowing for high intelligence and varied behaviors, from solitary to highly
                social, with notable examples including bats (only flying mammals) and blue whales (largest mammals).</p>
